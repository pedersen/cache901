Description: Tool for paperless geocaching
 Cache 901 is a tool for paperless geocaching. The early version is mostly
 proof of concept, but the later versions will allow the user an easy
 method to perform all functions for geocaching while using just a single
 netbook (such as the Asus EEE 901, which is where much development is
 taking place).
 .
 With version 0.2, we are only at proof of concept. Import of gpx files
 works, and the user is able to do basic searches.
